# Rock_Paper_Scissor
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:

- Rock (a fist)
- Paper (an open hand)
- Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

The possible outcomes are:

- Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
- Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)
- Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)

The game is often used as a decision-making tool and is simple yet entertaining.
